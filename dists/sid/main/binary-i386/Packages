Description: C++ metaprogramming library to make enums a little bit nicer
 WHAT'S INSIDE?
 .
   - Enums now come in three different flavors: static, dynamic and bit fields!
   - Enum values are now scoped out of namespace scope. Times of enum values
     conflict are gone.
   - Nice and customizable (de)serialization for enum to string equivalents.
   - Including dynamic enum values with offset and bit fields arbitrary
     composition!
   - Fresh and light as a native enum, no overhead over enum constants.
   - Limited overhead for serialization support.
   - Integer operations as easy and simple as ever.
 .
 CONCEPTS
 .
 This library introduces three new variation over the enum concept. The main
 difference between them is the way these enums are (de)serialized and the
 available enum / enum and enum / integer operators when this is meaningful
 (only when using C++0x).
 .
 Static enums only allow explicitly defined constants (with specified or
 implicit integer values), any other value will result in a (de)serialization
 to special value "unknown".
 Dynamic enums allow explicitly defined constants and offsets from these
 constants, within a given global range (from the first constant to the
 specified upper integer limit).
 .
 Every value whithin the range will be serializable, any other will result in
 "unknown". An integer value between two enum constants will be (de)serialized
 as the nearest lower enum constant plus an offset.
 .
 For example, if the enum is defined as { value1 = 1, value2 = 5..., unknown
 = 10 }, the available range would be from 1 to 9, and the integer 4 will be
 serialized as "value1#3" which means (value1 + 3).
 .
 Bit fields only allow combination of explicitly defined constants.
 .
 These will be (de)serialized as a combination of every defined enum constants,
 any other value will be (de)serialized as "unknown". This flavor restricts
 constants values to bitwise distinct integers, and to values different from 0
 in order to be able to decompose the enum into the specified enum constants.
 0 being the special "unknown" value for this flavor.
 .
 For example, for an enum defined as { bit1 = 0b001, bit2 = 0b010, bit3 =
 0b100... }, an instance of this enum with an integer value of 3 will be
 serialized as "bit1+bit2", and "bit1+bit3" will be deserialized as an enum
 instance of integer value 5.
